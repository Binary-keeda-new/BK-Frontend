  description: "Defining the structure of your database is paramount for data integrity. This chapter details how to create, alter, and drop tables using SQL DDL commands. It places a heavy emphasis on implementing business rules at the database level using constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK, ensuring robust data validation.",

It is broadly categorized into DDL (Data Definition Language for creating schemas), DML (Data Manipulation Language for CRUD operations), and DCL (Data Control Language for security). SQL is declarative, meaning the developer specifies *what* data they want, and the database optimizer determines the most efficient execution plan to retrieve it. Mastery of SQL involves understanding complex joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions to extract precise insights from massive datasets."
