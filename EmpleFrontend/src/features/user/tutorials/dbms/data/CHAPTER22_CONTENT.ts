  title: "Deadlocks",
  description: "When multiple transactions wait indefinitely for locks held by each other, a deadlock occurs. This chapter examines the conditions necessary for deadlocks and explores various mitigation strategies. You will learn about deadlock prevention protocols, deadlock detection using wait-for graphs, and the algorithms used to select victims for transaction recovery.",

      body: "In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term \"database\" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database."

Starvation may have a natural cause or be man-made. Deliberately inflicting starvation upon a population is a crime according to international criminal law and may also be used as a means of torture or execution."
